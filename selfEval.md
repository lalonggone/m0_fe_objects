# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - Workflow is definitely sub par right now. I think I started of strong, but let meself get distracted with things that I shouldn't prioritizing if I want to be successful at Turing. I think qitting my job will make a big difference in Mod 1 and I will also have to generally sacrifice more time with friends. 
    - My workspace is pretty comfortable, still a work in progress but I've been good at keeping it neat and organzied which is *huge* for my ADHD brain
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - When I went over the lesson materials before they were taught, it was really helpful. That is something I started to drop the ball on and noticed a big difference. Even just brushing up on the next lesson's vocab words. 
    - Taking better notes! I wish I could be one of those people that doesn't need to take notes but I don't think I am. Which is fine. I got much better at taking notes as time went on in mod0.
